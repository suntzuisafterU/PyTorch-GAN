## Dual gan experiments:

Failed.
With identity loss, learned the identity map.
Had to remove skip connections, but then it seemed to fail to create nice images.
They were blurry
That was with critic=5, trying critic=2.
Note that training epochs was faster with higher critic value, (about 3 times faster than cycleGAN or unit...)
So the training budget is different.
Results: critic=2 changed nothing...
